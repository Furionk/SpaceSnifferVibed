make a basic mvvm base for MainWindow


I can select a root folder to scan the size of all subfolders

fix the error

I can display the folder size in a heat map view like a well known software space sniffer

I can see the size of scanned folders reflected in HeatMapCanvas

in the heatmap view, should display the folder path like well known software spacesniffer

I can see the folder size in the heatmap

in the heatmap ui, parent folder rectangle should contains subfolders

should have no padding and clearly delcare to use System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle

the heatmap should make use of entire canvas not just horizontal

the heatmap should fill the window empty space

the HeatMapCanvas should follow window size, even the window resized

only show the folder name not entire path in heatmap

when resizing the window, the rectangles in heatmap also need to resize accordingly to make use of the canvas

i can double click the rectangles to open the folder accordingly

the SubfolderSizes listview should show all scanned folders not just single level


the listview should render only needed element to save performance

clicking the entire rectangle area can also open the folder

should make hover effect when hover on a rectangle
